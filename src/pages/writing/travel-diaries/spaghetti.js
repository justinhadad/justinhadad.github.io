Right now (forgive my present tense) I am drinking a gl√ºhwein outdoors enjoying Italian daylight, staring at the Matterhorn peak that establishes this village as an international must-see. Neehaar and Kiran are visiting me (and are skiing right now), Adelaide and Alex visited me last week, and every night of late has been bliss, with Celli, Luisa, Tom, Beatrice, and others.

         Anyway, as I said, I've decided to write everything out. Here goes.
