            said "Can you at least put it on a high gear?" He said "No." So I
            biked the last 19 miles on the lowest gear. Then I got to the run
            and ran the first mile split at sub-6 pace, because adrenaline, and
            then my body reminded me that I biked 19 miles on my bike's lowest
            gear and also that I biked 37 miles and swam two kilometers before
            that. Still finished, somehow.

            Practiced roughly 6x/week with varsity basketball players. Nicknamed
            "Little Man" because I was smaller than everyone else. Would have
            continued if not for pandemic restrictions.
