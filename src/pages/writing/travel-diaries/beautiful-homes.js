         In Munich I learned about people's homes. Melissa lives in Canada and plants trees and Kathi wrote a textbook based in German practice and Marcus misses Arizona and ZoÃ« breathes Prague. Mark served in Afghanistan and told me unrepeatable stories and then said Texas is hell. Alfonso covered my drinks because paying it forward is the most important thing, Emmanuel told me to stay at his parents house laid against the Alps because they want to meet me. The corner store-owner told me to never come back and then smiled when I came back.

       <p>
         Some pictures that collage:
       </p>

       <p>
         Banana bread and ice cream and coffee and Kathi.
       </p>
       <img 
         src="/images/Kathy.jpeg" 
         alt="Kathi and the 'nanas."
         className="w-full mb-4"
       />

       <p>
         Californian food because Marcus couldn't get enough.
       </p>
       <img 
         src="/images/marcus.jpg" 
         alt="Burritos baby"
         className="w-full mb-4"
       />

       <p>
         Noodle in a tree to last forever, courtesies to Melissa.
       </p>
       <img 
         src="/images/noodle.jpeg" 
         alt="Noodle still there?"
         className="w-full mb-4"
       />

       <p>
         And a quote from <em>The Song of Achilles</em> I enjoyed:
       </p>
       
       <p className="italic">
         I stopped watching for ridicule, the scorpion's tail hidden in his words. He said what he meant; he was puzzled if you did not. Some people might have mistaken this for simplicity. But is it not a sort of genius to cut always to the heart?
